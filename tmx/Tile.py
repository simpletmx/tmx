class Tile:

    """
    .. attribute:: id

       The local tile ID within its tileset.

    .. attribute:: type

       The type of the tile.  An arbitrary string.  Set to :const:`None`
       to not define a type.

    .. attribute:: terrain

       Defines the terrain type of each corner of the tile, given as
       comma-separated indexes in the list of terrain types in the order
       top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right.  Leaving out a
       value means that corner has no terrain. Set to :const:`None` for
       no terrain.

    .. attribute:: probability

       A percentage indicating the probability that this tile is chosen
       when it competes with others while editing with the terrain tool.
       Set to :const:`None` to not define this.

    .. attribute:: properties

       A list of :class:`Property` objects indicating the tile's
       properties.

    .. attribute:: image

       An :class:`Image` object indicating the tile's image.  Set to
       :const:`None` for no image.

    .. attribute:: animation

       A list of :class:`Frame` objects indicating this tile's animation.
       Set to :const:`None` for no animation.
