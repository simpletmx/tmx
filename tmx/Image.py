class Image:

    """
    .. attribute:: format

       Indicates the format of image data if embedded.  Should be an
       extension like ``"png"``, ``"gif"``, ``"jpg"``, or ``"bmp"``.
       Set to :const:`None` to not specify the format.

    .. attribute:: source

       The location of the image file referenced.  If set to
       :const:`None`, the image data is embedded.

    .. attribute:: trans

       A :class:`Color` object indicating the transparent color of the
       image, or :const:`None` if no color is treated as transparent.

    .. attribute:: width

       The width of the image in pixels; used for tile index correction
       when the image changes.  If set to :const:`None`, the image width
       is not explicitly specified.

    .. attribute:: height

       The height of the image in pixels; used for tile index correction
       when the image changes.  If set to :const:`None`, the image
       height is not explicitly specified.

    .. attribute:: data

       The image data if embedded, or :const:`None` if an external image
       is referenced.
