tmx is a simple library which reads and writes the Tiled TMX format.


INSTALLATION

First, install the dependencies:

- 3.4 or later <http://www.python.org>

Once you have all the dependencies, install tmx with the included
setup.py script, e.g. with "python3 setup.py install".

Alternatively, you can just place the "tmx" folder into the same
directory as the Python program that uses it. This can be a good idea
for the distribution of a game, since it reduces the number of
dependencies the user needs to install.


USAGE

Import the tmx library in your project file.  You can then save and
load TMX files with the tmx.TileMap class.

See the documentation found in the doc folder for detailed information.
